# CSUF CPSC 131 (Fall 2016)
# Chutes and Ladders Game

Course: CPSC 131 - Data Structures

Description: This project involves creating a game with the data structures learned in class, namely extendable vectors and array queues. The objectives of this game are to roll a dice, which would determine how many spaces the player can move for that turn, and to reach the corner opposite from the starting point of the board. If the player lands on a ladder tile, then he or she will either move up the ladder to the next row above or move down the ladder to the row below. 

Language(s) used: C++
